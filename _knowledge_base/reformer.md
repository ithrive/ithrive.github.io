The most recognisable piece of Pilates equipment, the Reformer is comprised of a sliding carriage complete with head rest and shoulder pads, connected to a series of springs of varying tension.  Altering the number of springs attached to the carriage allows us to vary the level of resistance. An adjustable foot bar and straps that may be used for both arm or leg work complete the package. 

The Reformer is a versatile apparatus that allows training in all positions - supine (lying down), seated, side-lying and standing and is used through all levels of Pilates repertoire from beginner to advanced. 

The most well known exercise on the Reformer is Footwork. In this exercise a client lays on the carriage with their feet on the foot-bar. Pressing the carriage out and in against resistance is basically like doing a squat whilst laying down! This allows us to train efficient hip/knee/ankle flexion/extension patterns while the trunk is supported. Exploring this movement in an unfamiliar orientation to gravity with support, allows both your nervous system and muscles to override persistent faulty movement patterns, explore new more efficient strategies, and ultimately strengthen these strategies to assist transference to a more functional, upright position.
