Initially designed by Joseph Pilates as a piece of lounge furniture that converted into an exercise machine, the wunda chair has undergone a number of re-designs over the years. These days there are a number of different versions available.

The combo chair has two pedals with two springs on each - one heavy and one light so you can choose your resistance.  Itâ€™s adjustable handles initially provide support for standing work and later allow for some impressive looking arm balances!

This apparatus is especially useful for exploring the relationship between the hamstrings and abdominals and also facilitates some really lovely spinal mobility work.
