A formidable looking piece of equipment, the trapeze table has a padded rectangular table base with a large poster frame attached. It also includes two cross bars, push through bar, a series of springs of varying lengths and tensions and of course - the trapeze!
The trapeze table has some fantastic options for early rehabilitation thanks to it’s ability to support the body and limbs against gravity through a range of movements.  At the opposite end of the movement spectrum the frame becomes a climbing gym and there are a series of hanging exercises that allow suspension from ankles, hands or both and even a complete inversion. There’s nothing quite as invigorating as a hang upside down!
