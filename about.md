        <p>
          I was not a confident mover growing up. I initially moved toward
          massage as a career, not because of an interest in sports or movement,
          but mostly because I am a natural nurturer.
        </p>
        <p>
          My passion for movement has actually developed out of the experiences
          Iâ€™ve had growing as a practitioner. Pilates, for example, gave me an
          excellent baseline strength and stability. JEMS ignited my curiosity
          about what my body was capable of. The Oov has provided an excellent
          restorative practice and an objective method for checking in with my
          body. And the Be Activated technique helped me to take my first full
          breath in many years!
        </p>
        <p>
          The more I learn, the better I move and the more confident I am to
          explore new things. I adore being able to share this knowledge with
          others and love watching people move with more confidence, spontaneity
          and freedom as a result!
