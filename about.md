        <h2 class="section_title">My story</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          A lot of what I know and teach has come from searching for solutions to my own injuries and issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          I used to suffer from a lot of lower back issues. My journey in addressing these issues lead me to Pilates, soft-tissue therapy and, more recently, JEMS.
        </p>
        <p>
          These systems have hugely helped me in achieving a sense of comfort in my body I hadn't experienced for years.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think a lot of people share a similar story to my own. I encourage you to read my full story. If you're interested in using any of these systems yourself, <a class="mailto" href="mailto:laura@ithrive.net.au">reach out to me</a> - I would love to hear from you.
