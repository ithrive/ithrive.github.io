			<h2>Pilates at Home</h2>
				<p>This is a great option for anyone in the Manly area with mobility or travel restrictions, children at home or just a busy lifestyle.  For your at home pilates experience, all you need to provide is the space.  Laura will bring a thick Pilates mat and a range of small apparatus to keep things interesting.</p>
				<p>As in the studio, we will start by finding out about your goals whether they be fitness based or have more of a rehabilitation focus.  Your session will then be tailored to your needs using either Pilates mat work, JEMS Movement ART techniques and exercises, or a combination of both.</p>
