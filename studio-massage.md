				<blockquote>Remedial Massage can be a powerful tool of positive change for your body. Certainly some of the manual techniques "go deep" and there can be a perception that this style of treatment is always painful. In my treatments I like to combine my clinical skills with my natural caring compassion and appreciation for rhythm and flow. The result is a treatment that is targeted intelligently to your needs but won't leave you feeling like you've gone 2 rounds with Tyson. The body is not something to be conquered, dominated or subdued. Precision and subtlety gains the best results, where we work with the body, not strain against it.</blockquote>
