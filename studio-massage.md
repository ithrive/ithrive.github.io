				<p>Remedial massage therapy is an <em>evidence-based</em> form of massage that may be used to <strong>reduce pain</strong> and <strong>restore function</strong> to your muscles, nerves and fascia.</p>
				<p>Massage therapy can also be used as a <strong>preventative strategy</strong> - helping you stay mobile and structurally balanced whatever the demands on your body</p>
				<!-- <p>Pregnancy, post-natal, aged care and sports (pre and post event) massage are also available</p> -->

				<h2 class="section_title">Techniques</h2>
				<p>Your session may use any of the following techniques:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Broad-handed Swedish techniques, myofascial release, trigger point therapy, deep ischaemic pressure, frictions, active and passive tissue tension, manual lymphatic drainage (MLD)</li>
					<li>Stretching techniques such as PNF (proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation),  MET (muscle energy technique), static stretches</li>
					<li>Neurodynamic techniques such as neural glides and neural tensioners</li>
					<li>Specific remedial exercises may then be recommended to enhance and maintain the results of your treatment or prevent re-occurrence</li>
				</ul>

				<blockquote>Remedial Massage can be a powerful tool of positive change for your body. Certainly some of the manual techniques "go deep" and there can be a perception that this style of treatment is always painful. In my treatments I like to combine my clinical skills with my natural caring compassion and appreciation for rhythm and flow. The result is a treatment that is targeted intelligently to your needs but won't leave you feeling like you've gone 2 rounds with Tyson. The body is not something to be conquered, dominated or subdued. Precision and subtlety gains the best results, where we work with the body, not strain against it.</blockquote>
