			<h2>Remedial Massage Therapy</h2>
			<p>Remedial massage therapy is an evidence-based form of massage that may be used to reduce pain and restore optimal function to your muscles, nerves and fascia; or as a preventative strategy, helping you stay mobile and posturally balanced whatever the demands on your body</p>
			<h3>During your appointment</h3>
			<p>Your remedial therapist will take your case history, conduct a postural analysis and use range of motion and other orthopaedic assessments appropriate to your presenting complaint.  They will then devise a treatment strategy tailored to you that may incorporate any of the following techniques:</p>
			<p>Broad-handed swedish techniques, myofascial release, trigger point therapy, deep ischaemic pressure, frictions, active and passive tissue tension, manual lymphatic drainage (MLD)</p>
			<p>Stretching techniques such as PNF (proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation),  MET (muscle energy technique), static stretches</p>
			<p>Neurodynamic techniques such as neural glides and neural tensioners</p>
			<p>Specific remedial exercises may then be reccommended to enhance and maintain the results of your treatment or prevent reoccurrence</p>
			<p><i>"Remedial Massage can be a powerful tool of positive change for your body. Certainly some of the manual techniques "go deep" and there can be a perception that this style of treatment is always painful.  In my treatments I like to combine my clinical skills with my natural caring compassion and appreciation for rhythm and flow. The result is a treatment that is targeted intelligently to your needs but won’t leave you feeling like you’ve gone 2 rounds with Tyson. The body is not something to be conquered, dominated or subdued. Subtlety usually gains the best results, where we work with the body, not strain against it."</i></p>
