			<h2>Remedial Massage Therapy</h2>
				<p>Remedial massage therapy is an evidence-based form of massage that may be used:</p>
				<ul>To reduce pain and restore optimal function to your muscles, nerves and fascia</ul>	
				<ul>As a preventative strategy, helping you stay mobile and posturally balanced whatever the demands on your body</ul>
			<h3>During your appointment</h3>
				<p>Laura will take your case history, conduct a postural analysis and use range of motion and other orthopaedic assessments appropriate to your presenting complaint.  We will then devise a treatment strategy tailored to you that may incorporate any of the following techniques:</p>
				<p>Broad-handed swedish techniques, myofascial release, trigger point therapy, deep ischaemic pressure, frictions, active and passive tissue tension, manual lymphatic drainage (MLD)</p>
				<p>Stretching techniques such as PNF (proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation),  MET (muscle energy technique), static stretches</p>
				<p>Neurodynamic techniques such as neural glides and neural tensioners</p>
				<p>Specific remedial exercises may then be reccommended to enhance and maintain the results of your treatment or prevent reoccurrence</p>

				<p><i>"Remedial Massage can be a powerful tool of positive change for your body. Certainly some of the manual techniques "go deep" and there can be a perception that this style of treatment is always painful.  In my treatments I like to combine my clinical skills with my natural caring compassion and appreciation for rhythm and flow. The result is a treatment that is targeted intelligently to your needs but won’t leave you feeling like you’ve gone 2 rounds with Tyson. The body is not something to be conquered, dominated or subdued. Precision and subtlety gains the best results, where we work with the body, not strain against it."</i></p>
