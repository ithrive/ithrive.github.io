Soft Tissue therapists have typically progressed through three levels of training:

Certificate IV in Massage Therapy: which provides basic Swedish/relaxation massage techniques.

Diploma of Remedial Massage: which provides a broader skill set enabling the treatment of common musculoskeletal complaints. Therapists at this level are typically geared toward symptom alleviation. This is the basic level of qualification required for claiming health fund rebates for massage. 

Advanced Diploma of Health Science - Soft Tissue Therapy (NSW) or Myotherapy (VIC): This qualification provides advanced assessment and treatment planning skills. These therapists are equipped to look beyond the "where" and understand the "why" and "how" of your complaint. That is, they look to identify and address the causative factors of your pain and are equipped to provide you with self-care to prevent recurrence.
