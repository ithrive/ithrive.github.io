Polestar is an international authority in Pilates education, focused on whole body wellness, healing through movement modalities and mind-body-spirit connectivity

Driven by its science and evidence-based curriculum, professional leadership and a variety of specialties, Polestar applies Pilates exercises in helping people either restore, achieve or excel in physical movement. Polestar Pilates can help relieve back pain, muscle pain, neck pain, shoulder impingement and other conditions impeding physical fitness. Polestar offers not only a road to recovery, but a way of wellness that can only be realized once pain is stabilized and alleviated.

Polestar Pilates can also aid in the treatment of post-surgical conditions, for those recovering from knee, hip, back or other surgeries. A Polestar practitioner can help to increase range of motion and diminish habits of guarding and over-recruitment of muscles to restore healthy movement patterns.
