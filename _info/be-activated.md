The Be Activated Techniques is an assessment and treatment method developed by South African Physiotherapist Douglas Heel. Assessment involves a sequence of muscle strength and flexibility tests that aims to identify your muscle recruitment and sequencing choices. Treatment is then geared toward optimising this sequencing to initiate from the powerful central muscles of the trunk and expand outward, rather than relying on peripheral structures that drive inward. 

An holistic, whole body treatment, it begins with addressing breathing restrictions and ultimately considers the function of all the major joints and muscles throughout the body.
