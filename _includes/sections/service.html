            “The JEMS mission is to enable people of all backgrounds, ages and
            levels of physical ability to learn the art of working with their
            body instead of against it, to have confidence in their bodies, and
            to reclaim and enjoy the activities that matter most to them.” -

        </h2>
        <p>
          The Oov® is both a diagnostic and a training tool. It’s a supportive
          device that facilitates decompression and optimal alignment of the
          spine while at the same time providing a multi-planar challenge to
          stability. The oov promotes rapid neuromuscular change by providing instant
          feedback.

          This system uses muscle strength tests to assess and then guide a form
          of myofascial release that aims to restore an expansive, centre-out
          movement strategy. It addresses breathing restrictions and promotes
          optimal interaction between diaphragm, psoas and gluteal muscles.
