			<h2>Studio Pilates</h2>
			<p>The perfect place for those just starting out, studio Pilates introduces the foundations to you with the support and novelty of all the wonderful Pilates equipment.  Studio workouts are also a great opportunity for the more experienced to really push the boundaries of their strength, coordination and movement integration</p>
			<p>Your workout may incorporate any or all of the following Pilates equipment:</p>
				<p>Reformer</p>
				<p>Trapeze Table</p>
				<p>Wunda chair</p>
				<p>Spine corrector</p>
			<p>or any of the small apparatus - swiss ball, magic circle, chi ball, foam roller, theraband, bosu, Franklin balls</p>
			<h3>Getting Started</h3>
			<h4>Initial Consultation</h4>
			<p>Your initial private session will include a chat about your intentions and goals for attending Pilates and some movement and mobility assessments.  This allows for development of your individual program and also provides some handy benchmarks for us to refer to later, as a measure of your progress!</p>
			<p>We will then move on to learn how to use your breath as a tool for movement, how to sense and use your abdominals effectively, as well as introducing you to your first repertoire on the equipment!  
			<p>$110</p>
			<h4>Studio Privates</h4>
			<p>Many people choose to continue on with regular private sessions.  Private tuition really allows you to fine tune your movement strategies, building strength, efficiency and robustness more quickly. If you are rehabiliating an injury or working toward a specific performance goal this is definitely the way to go.</p>
			<p>$110hr / $100hr for 10 sessions prepaid</p>
			<h4>Duets:</h4> 
			<p>Book your workout with a friend, partner or family member. Your program will still be individually tailored to your goals and abilities. Share the cost and double the fun!</p>
			<p>$65pp / $60pp for 10 sessions prepaid</p>
