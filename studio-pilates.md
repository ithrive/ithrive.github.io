				<h3>Introduction session</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-2">
						<p>We will start with a chat about your goals and then some movement and mobility assessments. This allows us to develop your individual program and determine some benchmarks to measure your progress against. We will then move on to learn how to use your breath as a tool for movement, how to sense and use your abdominals effectively, as well as introducing you to your first repertoire on the equipment!</p>

				<h3>Solo session</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-2">

Private tuition really allows you to fine tune your movement strategies, building strength, efficiency and robustness more quickly.
