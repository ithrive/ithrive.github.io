I originally trained as a Soft Tissue Therapist, graduating from Canberra Institute of Technology's excellent Advanced Diploma program in 2007. I spent the next 7 years honing my skills, working in a very progressive soft tissue therapy practice in Canberra. We had weekly educational tutorials  and a supportive senior team with an absolute wealth of experience. It was an enjoyable and rewarding role, but a very physical one. I was quickly massaging full time, often up to 40 hours per week and doing little to counteract the repetitive strain I was placing my body under. 

Eventually I found myself regularly on the other side of the treatment table, seeking help for recurrent low back and pelvic pain.

As I had been noticing more and more with my clients, the manual therapy I was receiving, whilst bringing relief from symptoms for a short while, was not helping me address the underlying reasons for them. I had to start taking more pro-active care of my body.

Starting Pilates was a real double whammy for me. First, it proved an excellent strategy for balancing my muscles and and improving my strength, flexibility and stability overall. Second, as I was then compelled to train as an instructor, it became an exciting new dimension to my work - one that thankfully had me moving in less repetitive and stressful ways.

ithrive Pilates (as it was then) was born soon after and I just fell in love with teaching mat classes. I loved watching people grow in confidence as they progressed. I loved the rhythm and flow that I would find while teaching.  Bodies moving well in harmony made me smile. 

I then also had the opportunity to return to CIT where I first did my training, as a teacher in the remedial massage program. Teaching is such an incredible privilege and I learned just as much in my time there as an educator if not more, as I did while I was a student!

I was no longer prone to episodes of acute disc and sacroiliac pain, however something was still not quite right. Inside a certain window of function, I performed well and was pain free. But when I pushed the boundaries a little I found things still fell apart. I could do some pretty cool looking things in Pilates class, but lacked a certain robustness when it came to moving fast, dynamically or unexpectedly.

This led me to continue searching, reading and trying new things, until the next piece of the puzzle came along in the way of <a href="http://www.jemsmovement.com">JEMS</a>. JEMS is a movement enhancement approach, built on a foundation of neuroscience, biomechanics, psychology and rehabilitation research. My first JEMS workshop was revelatory! I learned to sense and direct my body and movement with new subtlety. I felt my feet properly for the first time in years. Most importantly I experienced an ease in my body and posture that I thought was lost to me after injuring my back. 

That first workshop I attended in 2012 started a 6 year journey to becoming a certified JEMS clinical rehabilitation practitioner - one of the most profound and satisfying learning experiences of my life. 

Early on in this process, I had also moved to Sydney and upgraded my Pilates qualifications to include the studio method. I had the great fortune of joining the amazing team at Polestar Pilates in Brookvale, where I still teach a couple days a week. 

It was at Polestar Pilates that I first encountered the Oov and the amazing Nick Dawe. Nick is an innovative practitioner who partnered with Oov creator, Daniel Vladeta, to develop a unique diagnostic and treatment methodology employing the Oov. Nickâ€™s holistic approach emphasises the importance of breath, axial organisation and pelvic stability within a broader context aimed at optimising energy production, supporting detoxification and balancing the autonomic nervous system. His work and guidance has had an equally impactful effect on my own health, as on my approach to treatment. 

I hope that hearing my story gives you some insight into what I bring to the table as a therapist. Ultimately, wellness is a journey of discovery for all of us. The best practitioners I have encountered are excellent enquirers. As others have done for me in the past, I look forward to helping you ask the right questions to uncover what your body needs.
