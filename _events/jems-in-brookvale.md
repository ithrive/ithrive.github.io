What if there was a way to help real people to move beautifully, effectively, elegantly and powerfully?

What if you could see movement in a completely new but utterly logical way, understanding the biomechanics effortlessly, and opening new possibilities for people of all ages and abilities by assimilating the brain, body and emotion with function, physics and fascia?

Join international elite performance consultant, physiotherapist and renowned educator Joanne Elphinston as she demystifies the science, debunks the myths and inspires your passion for movement with JEMS®, a seamless integration of the art and science of holistic movement training for both health and performance.

This unique course celebrates the launch of Joanne's long awaited new book, The Power and the Grace, a Professional's Guide to Ease and Efficiency in Functional Movement.
